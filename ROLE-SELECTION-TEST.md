# Role Selection Testing Guide

## What Was Fixed

### Issue: "Profile Not Found" Error
- **Problem**: Users saw "Profile Not Found" page after login
- **Root Cause**: Test user mock profiles were being overwritten by database fetch attempts
- **Solution**: Modified `fetchUserProfile` to skip database queries for test users

### Previous Issue: Email Pattern Role Assignment  
- **Problem**: System used email patterns to determine user roles
- **Solution**: Now uses user-selected role during login

## Changes Made

### 1. AuthContext.tsx
- Updated `signIn` function to accept optional `role` parameter
- Modified test user logic to use selected role instead of hardcoded email-role mapping
- Added proper role storage for authenticated users
- **Fixed**: Prevented database profile fetching for test users to maintain mock profiles
- Created proper mock profiles for each role type (Student, Employee, TPOOfficer)

### 2. Login.tsx  
- Updated `signIn` call to pass the selected role: `signIn(email, password, role)`
- Maintained existing role selection UI and validation

### 3. Profile.tsx
- Displays comprehensive user information based on role
- Shows proper profile data from login-selected role
- **Fixed**: Now properly displays test user profiles without "Profile Not Found" error

## Testing Instructions

### Test User Accounts
Use any of these emails with password `12345678`:
- `student@gmail.com`
- `employee@gmail.com` 
- `tpo@gmail.com`

### Test Scenarios

1. **Student Role Selection**
   - Login with `student@gmail.com`
   - Select "Student" role in dropdown
   - Should navigate to Student Portal
   - Click "Profile" → Should show Student profile with university, course, skills
   - **Expected Profile Data**: Full name, email, student ID, university, course, graduation year, skills

2. **Employee Role Selection**
   - Login with `employee@gmail.com` 
   - Select "Employee" role in dropdown
   - Should navigate to Employee Portal
   - Click "Profile" → Should show Employee profile with company details
   - **Expected Profile Data**: Full name, email, employee ID, company, job title, experience, skills

3. **TPO Role Selection**
   - Login with `tpo@gmail.com`
   - Select "TPO" role in dropdown  
   - Should navigate to TPO Portal
   - Click "Profile" → Should show Microsoft Corporation profile
   - **Expected Profile Data**: Company info, CEO details, platform statistics

4. **Cross-Role Testing** (Key Test!)
   - Login with `student@gmail.com` but select "Employee" role
   - Should see Employee Portal instead of Student Portal
   - Profile should show Employee data, not Student data
   - This proves role selection overrides email patterns
